            In many cases customers can then also use the cart to transport
            their purchased goods to their vehicles, but some carts are designed
            to prevent them from leaving either the store or the designated
            parking area by magnetically locking the wheels. Returning the cart
            to its designated area releases the coin to the customer. Studies
            have shown that it is advisable for shoppers to sanitize the handles
            and basket areas prior to handling them or filling them with
            groceries due to high levels of bacteria that typically live on
            shopping carts.[1] This is due to the carts having a high level of
            exposure to the skin flora of previous users.

            In many places in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom,
            customers are encouraged to leave the carts in designated areas
            within the parking lot, and store employees will return the carts to
            the entrances.

            In some areas carts are connected by locking mechanisms that require
            the insertion of a coin or token to release an individual cart.
